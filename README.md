# arduino_MG_project
The project is IoT based. It consists of many components including Ultrasonic Sensors, DS18B20 (Temperature Sensor), LEDs and most importantly Arduino Uno board.

This project is about measuring distance using Ultrasonic Sensor and turning on an LED if object is closer than the defined distance. We have used 2 distance measuring sensors as of right and left. We have also placed a Temperature sensor in the middle of both the distance measing sensors.

It is a compulsion to download and install 2 particular libraries to run the code. Namely, 'OneWire' by Piotr Stolarz and 'DallasTemperature' by Miles Burton.
